function [ score ] = fitnessGrid( A, B, motion )
%FITNESSGRID defines a fitness function for the grid B. It evaluates how
%good the scan A, applied the transformation MOTION, fits in the grid. It
%counts without any explicit association how many cells overlap. A cell is
% said to overlap with another if it falls under a range of a 5*5 area.
